Data Analytics Process : Application in Real Life Scenario Case Study

Description : We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .

My task is to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process. 

I have prepared a PPT/PDF on a real-life scenario explaining it with the above process (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act).
